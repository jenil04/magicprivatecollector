        About Magic Private Collector
      </h1>
      <p>
        Magic Private Collector (MPC) is your one stop shop for creating, browsing, and buying private NFTs. It is a chain agnostic solution requiring no custom token to function. With an easy to use interface, MPC enables users with just a cryptocurrency wallet to create or buy NFTs which can be kept, shared, or sold. However, each NFT requires a user to provide proof of ownership via their wallet in order to use and view. There are myriad use cases for MPC including any secure content, time or quantity limited NFTs, content one wishes to only privately share or sell, and more.
